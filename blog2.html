                    <p>A compact capital with more bikes than cars, Copenhagen is a lively, modern city perfect for weekend getaways.

Copenhagen is also considered one of the world’s happiest cities, boasting plenty of green space, cool museums, and a rambunctious nightlife. Famed for its cyclist-friendly streets, there’s not only more bikes than cars here, there’s actually more bikes than people!

I’ve been visiting the city on and off for over 16 years and always have a blast. The quality of life here is virtually unrivaled. And while the city is expensive, it’s definitely possible to visit without breaking the bank.

To help you plan your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Copenhagen:

1. Hotel Bethel

   This three-star hotel is situated right on the canal in the center of Indre By, the most picturesque area of town. The hotel comprises three historic buildings, with large and spacious rooms that are clean and comfortable. The décor is modern, though a little dated, and generally quite minimalist (don’t expect much art or color). The carpeted rooms include a flatscreen TV, a desk, wardrobe, and free Wi-Fi. There’s no coffee/tea maker in the room, but I appreciate that the lounge has free coffee and tea 24/7. The breakfast, while not included, is filling and has a lot of variety, though it’s mostly cold foods like pastries, cold cuts, and cereal. The bathrooms are a bit small, but they are clean and the showers have great water pressure.

While there’s no gym or other facilities on site, the hotel has larger rooms perfect for families or groups. And you really can’t beat the location. It’s an affordable, central, no-frills choice.
2. Hotel Ottilia

Part of the former Carlsberg brewery, Otilia is a four-star property that has won several architecture awards for its transformation into a hotel. Located in Vesterbro, an area known for its excellent eateries and third-wave coffee shops, the standard rooms here are stylish but minimal, emphasizing contrasting light and dark tones. Rooms feature Wi-Fi, flatscreen TVs with Netflix, coffee/tea markers, and cozy chairs. If you’re on a budget and traveling solo, they have smaller rooms available too. The bathrooms have chic dark tile and include complimentary toiletries. I love that the bathroom floors are heated, so you stay nice and warm even in the winter. The shower pressure is great too, though just be aware that some rooms have open bathroom designs so privacy is limited.

Breakfast is filling and I especially like that it’s 100% organic. It’s served on the top floor so you can take in the view as you enjoy the fresh spread. Another nice touch is the daily happy hour with complimentary wine.
3. Hotel Sct. Thomas
A roomy hotel room with lots of natural light at Hotel Sct. Thomas in Copenhagen, Denmark
This three-star hotel is just a short walk from the Central Station and the Tivoli Gardens amusement park. Located in trendy Vesterbro, the rooms here are compact but functional, with a cozy Danish-inspired design featuring taupe and sage-green walls along with hardwood or parquet floors. The simple rooms feature a flatscreen TV, a small desk, clothes rack, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are also quite small, but the showers have decent water pressure. A tasty organic breakfast of fresh bread, fruit, and pastries is offered each morning too.

There’s also a chic lobby bar and a rooftop terrace to hang out on, complete with a bar and a sauna (you have to book and pay to use it though). The hotel was completely renovated in 2024 and is clean, comfortable, and perfect for budget travelers.
4. Boutique Hotel Herman K
A large and minimalist hotel room at Hotel Herman K in Copenhagen, Denmark
This four-star hotel located in Nyhavn is in a historic transformer station, so the entire place has a chic industrial style. The lobby is especially striking; it’s over two stories high and features a huge 3D-printed sculpture. I like that there’s a cool cocktail bar here too.

The large rooms feature minimal décor and have big windows that let in a lot of natural light. Rooms include soft beds, air conditioning, a Bose sound system, a flatscreen TV, comfy armchairs, a minibar, kettle, and free Wi-Fi. The marble bathrooms are bright and roomy, with complimentary eco-friendly toiletries and excellent water pressure. The breakfast each morning has lots of options (including veg options), and can be ordered as a buffet, a la carte, or continental. There’s no gym or spa on-site, but with its central location, you can pretty much walk to all the main sights from here. It’s a stylish, central choice.
5. Hotel Nora
A airy and spacious hotel room with bright red carpet at Hotel Nora in Copenhagen, Denmark
Located in the diverse Nørrebro neighborhood, this three-star hotel sits in an ornate 19th-century building. The rooms here are airy and bright and let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, but the rooms feature bright carpet that really makes the space pop. Amenities include a flatscreen TV, work desk, minifridge, coffee/tea maker, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are a little dated, but they have good water pressure and complimentary toiletries.

A fresh Danish breakfast is available each morning, and you can choose what you’d like to eat in advance (you order the night beforehand). I especially like that you get a bottle of water and a beer when you check in. There’s even a small rooftop terrace where you can hang out and enjoy the view over the city.
6. Hotel Skt Petri
A stylish hotel room with a large bed at Hotel Skt Petri in Copenhagen, Denmark
If you really want to splash out, this five-star hotel is located in Copenhagen’s old Latin Quarter, just minutes away from the main shopping street. The stylish rooms are large and invite in a lot of natural light. They feature darker tones and lots of dark blue, which contrasts nicely with the wooden furniture and minimal artwork. The beds are big and comfy, and rooms include a flatscreen TV, desk, minibar, coffee/tea maker, and parquet or hardwood floors. The large bathrooms are bright and boast complimentary toiletries and plush bathrobes.

There’s a bar in the expansive lobby (the hotel even crafts its own gin), a fitness center on-site, and parking is available for anyone traveling with a car. The breakfast is especially tasty, with fresh waffles, eggs, pastries, fruit, granola, and more. If you want to splurge, stay here.</p>
