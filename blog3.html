        THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN DUBROVNIK

Dubrovnik is a gorgeous historic city. Perched on the rugged coast of Croatia, it explodes to life every summer as cruisers, backpackers, and beachgoers flock to the city. With medieval charm, a UNESCO Old Town, and the glimmering azure backdrop of the Adriatic Sea, it’s no surprise that this is the most popular city in Croatia.

While the city struggles with overtourism, it’s easy to escape the crowds and soak up the local pace of life if you know where to go (and where to stay).

I’ve visited Dubrovnik a bunch over the years. These days, there are a lot more hotels than when I first arrived. Some are great, some are not so great. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Dubrovnik:

1. Art Hotel
A large and airy hotel room at the Art Hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This beachfront three-star hotel is just a two-minute stroll to the main beach in Lapad. The bright rooms are simply furnished and feature light, natural tones and small pieces of colorful artwork. The rooms have balconies, some of them with nice views, and also air conditioning, large flatscreen TVs, minibars, and a desk. The bathrooms aren’t huge (and the showers are a bit small), but they feature colorful tile, slippers, complimentary toiletries, and the water pressure is good.

The staff is amazing and the complimentary continental breakfast each morning is delicious, with a varied spread of local homemade food (like burek, a type of pastry) that changes daily. The main draw here is the location though. You can’t beat it if you want something near the beach!

2. Hotel Adria

This relaxing four-star hotel boasts two swimming pools as well as a spa and fitness center, making it a great choice for travelers looking to unwind. The rooms here are spacious and bright, with big beds and large windows that let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, with calming white and tan tones. Most rooms have balconies that look out over the marina, as well as a flatscreen TV, desk, safe, and coffee/tea maker. The bathrooms are also bright and spacious and the showers have great water pressure.

There’s also a varied (and included) buffet breakfast each morning with lots of options (including fresh fruit, pastries, juice, cereals). If you have a car, use of the hotel’s parking garage is complimentary.

3. Royal Palm Hotel
A spacious hotel room overlooking the sea at the Royal Palm Hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This five-star hotel in the Lapad neighborhood is one of the more affordable luxury options in town. The rooms here are a bit dated (the carpet and décor aren’t super modern) but they are spacious and airy and many offer gorgeous ocean views. Rooms include a TV, electric kettle, desk, minibar, and convenient outlets near the bed. The bathrooms are also large and bright, with stylish tile or marble, bathrobes, and complimentary toiletries. Some even have deep soaking tubs.

The complimentary breakfast buffet offers lots of variety, including an egg station, mimosas, and fresh pastries. There’s a relaxing spa here as well, in addition to a pool and gym. The beach is nearby too, but I especially like that the on-site terrace restaurant offers sweeping panoramic views of the Adriatic.

4. Hotel Lero
A cozy and relaxing room with lots of natural light in the Hotel Lero in Dubrovnik, Croatia
Located in the less-touristy Montovjerna neighborhood, this inviting four-star hotel is built around a relaxing outdoor pool. The rooms overlook the Adriatic and are spacious, featuring unique décor and design touches, such as colorful art or murals. Rooms also have air conditioning, minibars, coffeemakers, satellite TV, and large wardrobes.

The bathrooms are simple but the water pressure in the showers is great, plush bathrobes are included, and some rooms have both a bathtub and a shower. There are several fantastic restaurants here too, including a poolside bar, an award-winning Bosnian restaurant, and a Mediterranean restaurant offering a complimentary daily breakfast buffet with plenty of options for all diets.

5. Hotel More
A large hotel room with a big balcony overlooking the Adriatic at Hotel More in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This luxurious cliffside hotel is perched right on the water. A five-star hotel, all the rooms here have balconies that face the shimmering Adriatic. As a bonus, the hotel boasts the most unique bar in the city: the Cave Bar More. As the name suggests, it’s set in an actual cave right on the water.

The rooms here are massive, with super comfy beds, lots of natural light, and calming tones. They are furnished simply but elegantly, with wooden desks and a separate seating area with a sofa or easy chairs. In-room amenities include a desk, flatscreen TV, coffee/tea maker, minibar, and safe. The bathrooms are also spacious and include slippers, cozy bathrobes, luxe toiletries, and great water pressure. A complimentary breakfast buffet is available each morning, with fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, and pastries.

If you want to splash out on luxury, this is the hotel for you.

6. St. Joseph’s Hotel

Housed in a historic 16th-century building near two beautiful beaches, St. Joseph’s is one of a few hotels located within the walls of the Old Town. You’ll have a choice between standard hotel rooms and studio/apartment rooms. No matter your choice, all the rooms here are unique, with design touches that include hardwood floors, exposed brick and wooden ceiling beams, chandeliers, and antique furniture. It feels more like a B&B than a hotel. Expect amenities like flatscreen TVs, desk, and coffee/tea makers. The larger rooms have kitchen and laundry facilities.

The bathrooms feature beautiful tile or marble, rain showers (some also have massive bathtubs), slippers, and plush bathrobes. I especially like that the complimentary a la carte breakfast is cooked by a chef and served in your room each morning. It’s a nice personal touch that really elevates the whole experience here.
