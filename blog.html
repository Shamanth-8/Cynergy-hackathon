    <p>Unfortunately, as accommodation rentals have exploded into the mainstream, it’s become harder and harder to find great hosts. A lot of hosts now own multiple properties and live elsewhere. That means you often deal with property managers and never get to interact with the actual owner.

        Additionally, a lot of apartments aren’t quite as nice in reality as they appear in the photos (my team had to get a refund on an apartment in Boston because it was dirty and falling apart).
        
        In order to find suitable accommodation, I use the following criteria when looking for a place to stay on these platforms:
        
        Do they have positive reviews? – If other people stayed there, had a good time, and found the apartment as advertised, you probably will too.
        Do they have multiple listings? – This is important because many people use these sites to be property managers. They buy a bunch of apartments and then re-rent them on Airbnb. I try to avoid these places because they cause a lot of problems for the local rental market and lack the personal touch that comes when hosts rent out their own apartments.
        Do they have accurate photos? – Any listing that doesn’t include a lot of (quality) photos is probably hiding something (or at the very least misrepresenting the accommodation).
        Are they an active user or Superhost? – Active users are good users, so see when they last logged on. If it’s been a while, your query might go unanswered.
        Is their calendar updated? – While listings only show up in a search if they are available, hosts don’t always update their calendar. If someone hasn’t updated their calendar in 30 days, I tend to skip it. There’s nothing worse than going to book a place, only for them to cancel and say, “Whoops, sorry, it’s not available!”
        Are they verified? – Verified accounts are less likely to be people of suspicious quality, as the listing site has at least found some background information on them.
        Have they been someone else’s guest before? – If they were someone’s guest and that went well, it’s likely that they will be reliable.
        These rules are helpful guidelines, but at the end of the day, you have to go with your gut. I don’t need a listing to meet every point. I once had a host who hit only a couple of these points and she turned out to be my favorite host! And sometimes, in places without many hosts, you might have to be a little loose with this list.
        
        But the more points a place meets, the safer I feel.
        
        A Note on Gentrification/Legal Issues
        Over the years, Airbnb and other apartment rental websites have dramatically raised the price of rents and pushed out the locals you want to interact with as people have started to buy multiple properties in order to rent them out to tourists. It’s a big problem.
        
        In many places, like Lisbon and Venice, most locals can’t afford the price of rent anymore. And it’s not just cities. Rural areas are now becoming affected too.
        
        There have been strong protests against Airbnb (and similar sites) in Barcelona. Throughout Europe you often see “Airbnb go home!” graffiti. Japan cracked down on Airbnb. NYC has strict laws against it now too.
        
        Given local pushback and the issues with over tourism and the housing market, I strongly encourage you to only use Airbnb if you are renting a room in someone’s house if you can. As I mentioned above, Airbnb has a new feature called “Rooms” which allows you to easily search for rooms in people’s houses where they actually live. They are verified listings and a much better way to use the platform. It’s like how Airbnb used to be before it grew so big — people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash. I highly recommend it.
        
        However, if you can’t, try as hard as you can to make sure that the place you are renting is either a licensed B&B (if it’s only used for tourists) or someone’s house that they actually live in. This way you won’t add to any local housing issues!</p>
