    <h4>HOW TO FIND THE PERFECT APARTMENT FOR VACATION RENTALS</h4>

    <p>Unfortunately, as accommodation rentals have exploded into the mainstream, it’s become harder and harder to find great hosts. A lot of hosts now own multiple properties and live elsewhere. That means you often deal with property managers and never get to interact with the actual owner.

        Additionally, a lot of apartments aren’t quite as nice in reality as they appear in the photos (my team had to get a refund on an apartment in Boston because it was dirty and falling apart).
        
        In order to find suitable accommodation, I use the following criteria when looking for a place to stay on these platforms:
        
        Do they have positive reviews? – If other people stayed there, had a good time, and found the apartment as advertised, you probably will too.
        Do they have multiple listings? – This is important because many people use these sites to be property managers. They buy a bunch of apartments and then re-rent them on Airbnb. I try to avoid these places because they cause a lot of problems for the local rental market and lack the personal touch that comes when hosts rent out their own apartments.
        Do they have accurate photos? – Any listing that doesn’t include a lot of (quality) photos is probably hiding something (or at the very least misrepresenting the accommodation).
        Are they an active user or Superhost? – Active users are good users, so see when they last logged on. If it’s been a while, your query might go unanswered.
        Is their calendar updated? – While listings only show up in a search if they are available, hosts don’t always update their calendar. If someone hasn’t updated their calendar in 30 days, I tend to skip it. There’s nothing worse than going to book a place, only for them to cancel and say, “Whoops, sorry, it’s not available!”
        Are they verified? – Verified accounts are less likely to be people of suspicious quality, as the listing site has at least found some background information on them.
        Have they been someone else’s guest before? – If they were someone’s guest and that went well, it’s likely that they will be reliable.
        These rules are helpful guidelines, but at the end of the day, you have to go with your gut. I don’t need a listing to meet every point. I once had a host who hit only a couple of these points and she turned out to be my favorite host! And sometimes, in places without many hosts, you might have to be a little loose with this list.
        
        But the more points a place meets, the safer I feel.
        
        A Note on Gentrification/Legal Issues
        Over the years, Airbnb and other apartment rental websites have dramatically raised the price of rents and pushed out the locals you want to interact with as people have started to buy multiple properties in order to rent them out to tourists. It’s a big problem.
        
        In many places, like Lisbon and Venice, most locals can’t afford the price of rent anymore. And it’s not just cities. Rural areas are now becoming affected too.
        
        There have been strong protests against Airbnb (and similar sites) in Barcelona. Throughout Europe you often see “Airbnb go home!” graffiti. Japan cracked down on Airbnb. NYC has strict laws against it now too.
        
        Given local pushback and the issues with over tourism and the housing market, I strongly encourage you to only use Airbnb if you are renting a room in someone’s house if you can. As I mentioned above, Airbnb has a new feature called “Rooms” which allows you to easily search for rooms in people’s houses where they actually live. They are verified listings and a much better way to use the platform. It’s like how Airbnb used to be before it grew so big — people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash. I highly recommend it.
        
        However, if you can’t, try as hard as you can to make sure that the place you are renting is either a licensed B&B (if it’s only used for tourists) or someone’s house that they actually live in. This way you won’t add to any local housing issues!</p>

                        <p>A compact capital with more bikes than cars, Copenhagen is a lively, modern city perfect for weekend getaways.

Copenhagen is also considered one of the world’s happiest cities, boasting plenty of green space, cool museums, and a rambunctious nightlife. Famed for its cyclist-friendly streets, there’s not only more bikes than cars here, there’s actually more bikes than people!

I’ve been visiting the city on and off for over 16 years and always have a blast. The quality of life here is virtually unrivaled. And while the city is expensive, it’s definitely possible to visit without breaking the bank.

To help you plan your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Copenhagen:

1. Hotel Bethel

       This three-star hotel is situated right on the canal in the center of Indre By, the most picturesque area of town. The hotel comprises three historic buildings, with large and spacious rooms that are clean and comfortable. The décor is modern, though a little dated, and generally quite minimalist (don’t expect much art or color). The carpeted rooms include a flatscreen TV, a desk, wardrobe, and free Wi-Fi. There’s no coffee/tea maker in the room, but I appreciate that the lounge has free coffee and tea 24/7. The breakfast, while not included, is filling and has a lot of variety, though it’s mostly cold foods like pastries, cold cuts, and cereal. The bathrooms are a bit small, but they are clean and the showers have great water pressure.

While there’s no gym or other facilities on site, the hotel has larger rooms perfect for families or groups. And you really can’t beat the location. It’s an affordable, central, no-frills choice.
 2. Hotel Ottilia
A bright and spacious hotel room at Hotel Ottilia in Copenhagen, Denmark
Part of the former Carlsberg brewery, Otilia is a four-star property that has won several architecture awards for its transformation into a hotel. Located in Vesterbro, an area known for its excellent eateries and third-wave coffee shops, the standard rooms here are stylish but minimal, emphasizing contrasting light and dark tones. Rooms feature Wi-Fi, flatscreen TVs with Netflix, coffee/tea markers, and cozy chairs. If you’re on a budget and traveling solo, they have smaller rooms available too. The bathrooms have chic dark tile and include complimentary toiletries. I love that the bathroom floors are heated, so you stay nice and warm even in the winter. The shower pressure is great too, though just be aware that some rooms have open bathroom designs so privacy is limited.

Breakfast is filling and I especially like that it’s 100% organic. It’s served on the top floor so you can take in the view as you enjoy the fresh spread. Another nice touch is the daily happy hour with complimentary wine.
3. Hotel Sct. Thomas
A roomy hotel room with lots of natural light at Hotel Sct. Thomas in Copenhagen, Denmark
This three-star hotel is just a short walk from the Central Station and the Tivoli Gardens amusement park. Located in trendy Vesterbro, the rooms here are compact but functional, with a cozy Danish-inspired design featuring taupe and sage-green walls along with hardwood or parquet floors. The simple rooms feature a flatscreen TV, a small desk, clothes rack, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are also quite small, but the showers have decent water pressure. A tasty organic breakfast of fresh bread, fruit, and pastries is offered each morning too.

There’s also a chic lobby bar and a rooftop terrace to hang out on, complete with a bar and a sauna (you have to book and pay to use it though). The hotel was completely renovated in 2024 and is clean, comfortable, and perfect for budget travelers.
 4. Boutique Hotel Herman K
A large and minimalist hotel room at Hotel Herman K in Copenhagen, Denmark
This four-star hotel located in Nyhavn is in a historic transformer station, so the entire place has a chic industrial style. The lobby is especially striking; it’s over two stories high and features a huge 3D-printed sculpture. I like that there’s a cool cocktail bar here too.

The large rooms feature minimal décor and have big windows that let in a lot of natural light. Rooms include soft beds, air conditioning, a Bose sound system, a flatscreen TV, comfy armchairs, a minibar, kettle, and free Wi-Fi. The marble bathrooms are bright and roomy, with complimentary eco-friendly toiletries and excellent water pressure. The breakfast each morning has lots of options (including veg options), and can be ordered as a buffet, a la carte, or continental. There’s no gym or spa on-site, but with its central location, you can pretty much walk to all the main sights from here. It’s a stylish, central choice.
5. Hotel Nora
A airy and spacious hotel room with bright red carpet at Hotel Nora in Copenhagen, Denmark
Located in the diverse Nørrebro neighborhood, this three-star hotel sits in an ornate 19th-century building. The rooms here are airy and bright and let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, but the rooms feature bright carpet that really makes the space pop. Amenities include a flatscreen TV, work desk, minifridge, coffee/tea maker, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are a little dated, but they have good water pressure and complimentary toiletries.

A fresh Danish breakfast is available each morning, and you can choose what you’d like to eat in advance (you order the night beforehand). I especially like that you get a bottle of water and a beer when you check in. There’s even a small rooftop terrace where you can hang out and enjoy the view over the city.
6. Hotel Skt Petri
A stylish hotel room with a large bed at Hotel Skt Petri in Copenhagen, Denmark
If you really want to splash out, this five-star hotel is located in Copenhagen’s old Latin Quarter, just minutes away from the main shopping street. The stylish rooms are large and invite in a lot of natural light. They feature darker tones and lots of dark blue, which contrasts nicely with the wooden furniture and minimal artwork. The beds are big and comfy, and rooms include a flatscreen TV, desk, minibar, coffee/tea maker, and parquet or hardwood floors. The large bathrooms are bright and boast complimentary toiletries and plush bathrobes.

There’s a bar in the expansive lobby (the hotel even crafts its own gin), a fitness center on-site, and parking is available for anyone traveling with a car. The breakfast is especially tasty, with fresh waffles, eggs, pastries, fruit, granola, and more. If you want to splurge, stay here.</p>

        THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN DUBROVNIK

Dubrovnik is a gorgeous historic city. Perched on the rugged coast of Croatia, it explodes to life every summer as cruisers, backpackers, and beachgoers flock to the city. With medieval charm, a UNESCO Old Town, and the glimmering azure backdrop of the Adriatic Sea, it’s no surprise that this is the most popular city in Croatia.

While the city struggles with overtourism, it’s easy to escape the crowds and soak up the local pace of life if you know where to go (and where to stay).

I’ve visited Dubrovnik a bunch over the years. These days, there are a lot more hotels than when I first arrived. Some are great, some are not so great. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Dubrovnik:

1. Art Hotel
A large and airy hotel room at the Art Hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This beachfront three-star hotel is just a two-minute stroll to the main beach in Lapad. The bright rooms are simply furnished and feature light, natural tones and small pieces of colorful artwork. The rooms have balconies, some of them with nice views, and also air conditioning, large flatscreen TVs, minibars, and a desk. The bathrooms aren’t huge (and the showers are a bit small), but they feature colorful tile, slippers, complimentary toiletries, and the water pressure is good.

The staff is amazing and the complimentary continental breakfast each morning is delicious, with a varied spread of local homemade food (like burek, a type of pastry) that changes daily. The main draw here is the location though. You can’t beat it if you want something near the beach!

2. Hotel Adria
A huge, comfy bed in a big hotel room at Hotel Adria in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This relaxing four-star hotel boasts two swimming pools as well as a spa and fitness center, making it a great choice for travelers looking to unwind. The rooms here are spacious and bright, with big beds and large windows that let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, with calming white and tan tones. Most rooms have balconies that look out over the marina, as well as a flatscreen TV, desk, safe, and coffee/tea maker. The bathrooms are also bright and spacious and the showers have great water pressure.

There’s also a varied (and included) buffet breakfast each morning with lots of options (including fresh fruit, pastries, juice, cereals). If you have a car, use of the hotel’s parking garage is complimentary.

3. Royal Palm Hotel
A spacious hotel room overlooking the sea at the Royal Palm Hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This five-star hotel in the Lapad neighborhood is one of the more affordable luxury options in town. The rooms here are a bit dated (the carpet and décor aren’t super modern) but they are spacious and airy and many offer gorgeous ocean views. Rooms include a TV, electric kettle, desk, minibar, and convenient outlets near the bed. The bathrooms are also large and bright, with stylish tile or marble, bathrobes, and complimentary toiletries. Some even have deep soaking tubs.

The complimentary breakfast buffet offers lots of variety, including an egg station, mimosas, and fresh pastries. There’s a relaxing spa here as well, in addition to a pool and gym. The beach is nearby too, but I especially like that the on-site terrace restaurant offers sweeping panoramic views of the Adriatic.

4. Hotel Lero
A cozy and relaxing room with lots of natural light in the Hotel Lero in Dubrovnik, Croatia
Located in the less-touristy Montovjerna neighborhood, this inviting four-star hotel is built around a relaxing outdoor pool. The rooms overlook the Adriatic and are spacious, featuring unique décor and design touches, such as colorful art or murals. Rooms also have air conditioning, minibars, coffeemakers, satellite TV, and large wardrobes.

The bathrooms are simple but the water pressure in the showers is great, plush bathrobes are included, and some rooms have both a bathtub and a shower. There are several fantastic restaurants here too, including a poolside bar, an award-winning Bosnian restaurant, and a Mediterranean restaurant offering a complimentary daily breakfast buffet with plenty of options for all diets.

5. Hotel More
A large hotel room with a big balcony overlooking the Adriatic at Hotel More in Dubrovnik, Croatia
This luxurious cliffside hotel is perched right on the water. A five-star hotel, all the rooms here have balconies that face the shimmering Adriatic. As a bonus, the hotel boasts the most unique bar in the city: the Cave Bar More. As the name suggests, it’s set in an actual cave right on the water.

The rooms here are massive, with super comfy beds, lots of natural light, and calming tones. They are furnished simply but elegantly, with wooden desks and a separate seating area with a sofa or easy chairs. In-room amenities include a desk, flatscreen TV, coffee/tea maker, minibar, and safe. The bathrooms are also spacious and include slippers, cozy bathrobes, luxe toiletries, and great water pressure. A complimentary breakfast buffet is available each morning, with fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, and pastries.

If you want to splash out on luxury, this is the hotel for you.

6. St. Joseph’s Hotel
A large hotel room at St. Joseph's Hotel with exposed brick and pastel colors in Dubrovnik, Croatia
Housed in a historic 16th-century building near two beautiful beaches, St. Joseph’s is one of a few hotels located within the walls of the Old Town. You’ll have a choice between standard hotel rooms and studio/apartment rooms. No matter your choice, all the rooms here are unique, with design touches that include hardwood floors, exposed brick and wooden ceiling beams, chandeliers, and antique furniture. It feels more like a B&B than a hotel. Expect amenities like flatscreen TVs, desk, and coffee/tea makers. The larger rooms have kitchen and laundry facilities.

The bathrooms feature beautiful tile or marble, rain showers (some also have massive bathtubs), slippers, and plush bathrobes. I especially like that the complimentary a la carte breakfast is cooked by a chef and served in your room each morning. It’s a nice personal touch that really elevates the whole experience here.

        Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in Italy. Its entire historic center is a picturesque UNESCO World Heritage Site, there’s art everywhere, and the food here is insanely delicious.

I’ve been visiting the city off and on for the past sixteen years and am always blown away by how gorgeous it is. Visiting here feels like you’ve stepped back in time.

Since Florence is such a popular destination, there are tons of hotels here. Some of them are great, and some of them not so great. Over the years, I’ve stayed in a lot of different hotels in the city. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Florence:

1. Hotel Alba Palace
A hotel room with a simple double bed, a desk, paintings of Florence on the soft yellow walls, and a gilded wardrobe in the corner at Hotel Alba Palace in Florence, Italy
Located next to the cloisters of the Santa Maria Novella Basilica, this beautiful three-star hotel is decorated in a traditional Florentine style. Each room is unique, with soft yellow walls and historic features that include antique terracotta floors, arched ceilings, and exposed brick walls. The complimentary breakfast is fantastic, with a lot of variety (such as pastries, yogurt, cakes, cold cuts, and espresso drinks). Best of all, it’s served in a tranquil atrium with a glass ceiling.

All rooms have a flatscreen TV, minibar, desk, Nespresso machine, hairdryer, and safe. The beds are comfy and the windows are soundproofed, so you’ll be able to sleep well here. While the bathrooms are a bit small, there’s excellent water pressure in the showers, a bidet, towel warming racks, and complimentary toiletries. In addition to classic rooms with a double bed, there are also cheaper rooms with single beds for solo travelers. Overall, it’s an affordable choice in one of the better neighborhoods in the city.

2. Hotel Davanzati
a hotel room with two twin beds next to each other, a desk, a wooden wardrobe, terracotta tiled floors, and soft lighting, at Hotel Davanzati in Florence, Italy
This cozy three-star hotel in the heart of the historic center (just a block from Ponte Vecchio) offers a lot of value. The free continental breakfast is quite varied, with fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, pastries, and cold cuts. There are also social hours with complimentary drinks and snacks, including afternoon tea and cakes, and an aperitivo with Prosecco and savory bites.

The rooms are decorated with pastel-colored walls that have historic drawings and maps on them. All rooms are pretty spacious and feature comfy beds, a desk, flatscreen TV, and a wardrobe. The bathrooms are large too and have heated towel racks as well as showers with excellent water pressure. The staff really go out of their way to help with anything you need too. (Just be aware that there is no elevator, so it’s not the best choice for those with mobility issues.)

3. The Place Firenze
A luxurious bathroom filled with a large bathtub, wooden floors, and windows with a view of the Duomo out of one of them at The Place, a five-star hotel in Florence, Italy
This five-star hotel is located right on Piazza Santa Maria Novella in a restored 17th-century building. The hotel has an outdoor terrace right on the piazza, offering Tuscan specialties, drinks, and an excellent breakfast spread in the morning (it’s included in your stay). There’s also a small rooftop with incredible views and free access to a gym just a couple of minutes away.

An award-winning boutique property (there are just 20 rooms here), all the rooms are individually decorated in pastel colors, with unique artwork, chandeliers, and bespoke furniture. There’s lots of natural light in the rooms too, and amenities include a minibar (with complimentary soft drinks and snacks), flatscreen TV, and spacious desk. The elegant marble bathrooms have a bidet, complimentary luxury toiletries, plush bathrobes, and slippers. The showers have good pressure, and some rooms have separate deep tubs too. You’ll want for nothing here, though if you do, the exceptionally helpful staff will go out of their way to get it for you. It’s the most exclusive hotel in the city and the place to stay if you’re looking to splurge in Florence.

4. La Maison du Sage
A hotel room with vibrant salmon colored walls, and a bed, desk, and mirrors all in a funky wooden Art Deco style at La Maison du Sage, a hotel in Florence, Italy
This three-star hotel is tucked just off Piazza di Santa Croce in the heart of the lively Santa Croce neighborhood. A boutique property, the entire place is eclectically designed with interesting artwork and walls painted with fun pastel colors. I especially love all the cool wooden Art Deco furniture. There’s also an excellent breakfast buffet featuring pastries, juice, eggs, ham, cheese, and fresh fruit.

The spacious rooms are filled with natural light and have the same chic design as the rest of the hotel. All rooms have hardwood or parquet floors and include a minibar, flatscreen satellite TV, Nespresso coffee machine, and kettle for tea. The bathrooms are large and feature walk-in rainfall showers (some with a separate soaking tub), heated towel racks, and a bidet. This is a great choice for travelers who want to stay close to Centro Storico but want a more local experience. It’s a really nice property that offers outsized value for the price.

5. Hotel Palazzo Guadagni
A rooftop terrace with chairs and tables overlooking the cityscape of Florence, Italy at Hotel Palazzo Guadagni
This three-star hotel is set in a 16th-century Florentine palace right on Piazza Santo Spirito in the trendy Santo Spirito neighborhood. The smartly decorated rooms retain many of the features from their aristocratic days, such as high ceilings, large windows, antique furniture, frescoed ceilings, and fireplaces. In-room amenities include a minibar, flatscreen TV, and a safe. The large and tiled bathrooms offer heated towel racks, a bidet, fluffy bathrobes, and slippers.

But my favorite part of this hotel is the rooftop terrace and its stunning views over the city. In the mornings, they offer a fantastic complimentary breakfast spread, and at night you can enjoy the sun setting over the red rooftops with a drink in hand. It feels much more luxurious than your typical three-star hotel here. I think this is the perfect choice for intrepid travelers who want to experience local Florentine life on the other side of the Arno River.

6. Hotel Bernini Palace
A luxurious bed with a golden headboard at Hotel Bernini Palace, a five-star hotel in Florence, Italy
This five-star hotel is set in a 15th-century building and, true to its name, it feels like you’re staying in a palace here. The grand lobby is decorated in fusion of Italian and Moroccan styles, featuring arched ceilings and doorways. I really like that the complimentary breakfast buffet is served in a room with a lot of history (Italian heads of Parliament used to meet here) and a beautiful, frescoed ceiling.

The elegant rooms feature wood-beamed ceilings, parquet or terracotta floors, glass chandeliers, antique furnishings, and comfy beds with gilded headboards. The rooms are spacious and have all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber, including minibars, flatscreen TVs, desks, and air conditioning. The marble bathrooms are huge too and include a bidet, plush bathrobes and slippers, and a hairdryer. This is the best place to stay for luxury in the heart of Florence (it’s just a five-minute walk to the Duomo).

Florence is one of my favorite cities in Italy. It’s not only one of the most stunning cities in Italy, but in all of Europe. Just be sure to pick one of the hotels from the list above for your stay. Do that, and you’ll have an amazing visit to this picturesque city!
