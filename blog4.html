        Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in Italy. Its entire historic center is a picturesque UNESCO World Heritage Site, there’s art everywhere, and the food here is insanely delicious.

I’ve been visiting the city off and on for the past sixteen years and am always blown away by how gorgeous it is. Visiting here feels like you’ve stepped back in time.

Since Florence is such a popular destination, there are tons of hotels here. Some of them are great, and some of them not so great. Over the years, I’ve stayed in a lot of different hotels in the city. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Florence:

1. Hotel Alba Palace
A hotel room with a simple double bed, a desk, paintings of Florence on the soft yellow walls, and a gilded wardrobe in the corner at Hotel Alba Palace in Florence, Italy
Located next to the cloisters of the Santa Maria Novella Basilica, this beautiful three-star hotel is decorated in a traditional Florentine style. Each room is unique, with soft yellow walls and historic features that include antique terracotta floors, arched ceilings, and exposed brick walls. The complimentary breakfast is fantastic, with a lot of variety (such as pastries, yogurt, cakes, cold cuts, and espresso drinks). Best of all, it’s served in a tranquil atrium with a glass ceiling.

All rooms have a flatscreen TV, minibar, desk, Nespresso machine, hairdryer, and safe. The beds are comfy and the windows are soundproofed, so you’ll be able to sleep well here. While the bathrooms are a bit small, there’s excellent water pressure in the showers, a bidet, towel warming racks, and complimentary toiletries. In addition to classic rooms with a double bed, there are also cheaper rooms with single beds for solo travelers. Overall, it’s an affordable choice in one of the better neighborhoods in the city.

2. Hotel Davanzati
a hotel room with two twin beds next to each other, a desk, a wooden wardrobe, terracotta tiled floors, and soft lighting, at Hotel Davanzati in Florence, Italy
This cozy three-star hotel in the heart of the historic center (just a block from Ponte Vecchio) offers a lot of value. The free continental breakfast is quite varied, with fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, pastries, and cold cuts. There are also social hours with complimentary drinks and snacks, including afternoon tea and cakes, and an aperitivo with Prosecco and savory bites.

The rooms are decorated with pastel-colored walls that have historic drawings and maps on them. All rooms are pretty spacious and feature comfy beds, a desk, flatscreen TV, and a wardrobe. The bathrooms are large too and have heated towel racks as well as showers with excellent water pressure. The staff really go out of their way to help with anything you need too. (Just be aware that there is no elevator, so it’s not the best choice for those with mobility issues.)

3. The Place Firenze
A luxurious bathroom filled with a large bathtub, wooden floors, and windows with a view of the Duomo out of one of them at The Place, a five-star hotel in Florence, Italy
This five-star hotel is located right on Piazza Santa Maria Novella in a restored 17th-century building. The hotel has an outdoor terrace right on the piazza, offering Tuscan specialties, drinks, and an excellent breakfast spread in the morning (it’s included in your stay). There’s also a small rooftop with incredible views and free access to a gym just a couple of minutes away.

An award-winning boutique property (there are just 20 rooms here), all the rooms are individually decorated in pastel colors, with unique artwork, chandeliers, and bespoke furniture. There’s lots of natural light in the rooms too, and amenities include a minibar (with complimentary soft drinks and snacks), flatscreen TV, and spacious desk. The elegant marble bathrooms have a bidet, complimentary luxury toiletries, plush bathrobes, and slippers. The showers have good pressure, and some rooms have separate deep tubs too. You’ll want for nothing here, though if you do, the exceptionally helpful staff will go out of their way to get it for you. It’s the most exclusive hotel in the city and the place to stay if you’re looking to splurge in Florence.

4. La Maison du Sage
A hotel room with vibrant salmon colored walls, and a bed, desk, and mirrors all in a funky wooden Art Deco style at La Maison du Sage, a hotel in Florence, Italy
This three-star hotel is tucked just off Piazza di Santa Croce in the heart of the lively Santa Croce neighborhood. A boutique property, the entire place is eclectically designed with interesting artwork and walls painted with fun pastel colors. I especially love all the cool wooden Art Deco furniture. There’s also an excellent breakfast buffet featuring pastries, juice, eggs, ham, cheese, and fresh fruit.

The spacious rooms are filled with natural light and have the same chic design as the rest of the hotel. All rooms have hardwood or parquet floors and include a minibar, flatscreen satellite TV, Nespresso coffee machine, and kettle for tea. The bathrooms are large and feature walk-in rainfall showers (some with a separate soaking tub), heated towel racks, and a bidet. This is a great choice for travelers who want to stay close to Centro Storico but want a more local experience. It’s a really nice property that offers outsized value for the price.

5. Hotel Palazzo Guadagni
A rooftop terrace with chairs and tables overlooking the cityscape of Florence, Italy at Hotel Palazzo Guadagni
This three-star hotel is set in a 16th-century Florentine palace right on Piazza Santo Spirito in the trendy Santo Spirito neighborhood. The smartly decorated rooms retain many of the features from their aristocratic days, such as high ceilings, large windows, antique furniture, frescoed ceilings, and fireplaces. In-room amenities include a minibar, flatscreen TV, and a safe. The large and tiled bathrooms offer heated towel racks, a bidet, fluffy bathrobes, and slippers.

But my favorite part of this hotel is the rooftop terrace and its stunning views over the city. In the mornings, they offer a fantastic complimentary breakfast spread, and at night you can enjoy the sun setting over the red rooftops with a drink in hand. It feels much more luxurious than your typical three-star hotel here. I think this is the perfect choice for intrepid travelers who want to experience local Florentine life on the other side of the Arno River.

6. Hotel Bernini Palace

This five-star hotel is set in a 15th-century building and, true to its name, it feels like you’re staying in a palace here. The grand lobby is decorated in fusion of Italian and Moroccan styles, featuring arched ceilings and doorways. I really like that the complimentary breakfast buffet is served in a room with a lot of history (Italian heads of Parliament used to meet here) and a beautiful, frescoed ceiling.

The elegant rooms feature wood-beamed ceilings, parquet or terracotta floors, glass chandeliers, antique furnishings, and comfy beds with gilded headboards. The rooms are spacious and have all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber, including minibars, flatscreen TVs, desks, and air conditioning. The marble bathrooms are huge too and include a bidet, plush bathrobes and slippers, and a hairdryer. This is the best place to stay for luxury in the heart of Florence (it’s just a five-minute walk to the Duomo).

Florence is one of my favorite cities in Italy. It’s not only one of the most stunning cities in Italy, but in all of Europe. Just be sure to pick one of the hotels from the list above for your stay. Do that, and you’ll have an amazing visit to this picturesque city!
